**Deep Learning Introduction**

1.Deep Learning is defines about to work on complex Neural Networks.This topic is subset of Machine Learning.

2.**Types of Layers :** 
**a.Iput Layer :** 
              This layer consist of all the input given to model for prediction.Input Layer receives the raw data to the machine.

**b.Hidden Layer:**
            This layer processess the input data and makes neuron that makes prediction or makes data integrated with each other.

**c.Output Layer:**
          This layer contains all the information about the data and can be able to make predictions.

**3.Activation Function :** 
        a.ReLu : Rectified Liner Unit:
                Which is used to the hidden layers to show the data in the gradients of the data and which is simply used to speed up during the training of the data.

        b.Sigmoid : 
                Map the values binary () and 1 in the layers.)

        c. Softmax : 
            Convert the data row into completely 1.But the data should be in propability.
**Back propagation and Optimisation **

      In this propagation step we use some of the example -mse(Mean Sqaure Error ),Cross Entropy Stop:which are the optimizer.
